# 💸 Tip Calculator

**Bootcamp Day 2 Project – From Angela Yu's "100 Days of Python" Course**

## 📝 Description

A beginner-friendly Python script that helps you split a bill among friends — including a tip. Enter the bill amount, tip percentage, and number of people, and the calculator tells you how much each person should pay. Perfect for nights out and practicing core Python concepts.

## ✨ Features

- 🧾 Takes user input for total bill amount
- 💰 Asks what tip percentage you'd like to give
- 👥 Splits the total bill among a given number of people
- 🧮 Calculates each person's share with tip
- 🖨️ Prints the final amount each person should pay, rounded to two decimal places

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qusai-Kagalwala/tip-split-calculator.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tip-split-calculator
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 💻 Example Usage

```
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? → $124.56
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? → 12
How many people to split the bill? → 4
Each person should pay: $34.84
```

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x
- Basic input/output
- Arithmetic and rounding functions
- String formatting with f-strings

## 🌱 Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

- Taking user input using `input()`
- Type casting (`str`, `int`, `float`)
- Performing mathematical operations
- Formatting and rounding floats to two decimal places
- Basic terminal interaction and user-friendly output

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add tip suggestions based on bill total
- Handle invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers, non-numeric values)
- Support for different currencies
- Add a GUI using Tkinter or web version using Flask
